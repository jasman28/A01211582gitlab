Markdown is a way to style text on the web. One can easily control the display of the document;formatting words as bold or italics, adding
images and creating lists as well.They are represented as # or *

It is preferred over .html and .txt because  it is very easy to make dome words bold and other words italics which is possible in
html using tags and txt using other aspects.
Moreover, it is crash-free.
